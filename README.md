# Wireless-Buzzer-System

## Overview

Wireless-Buzzer-System is an open-source solution that enables remote control of a buzzer connected to a Raspberry Pi through a networked client-server setup. It facilitates real-time hardware interaction, making it ideal for IoT and automation projects.

### Why Wireless-Buzzer-System?

This project streamlines remote hardware management with robust network communication.  
The core features include:

-  **UDP Communication**: Enables fast, reliable message exchange between client and server.
-  **Command Validation & Timeout**: Ensures commands are correctly transmitted and responses are timely.
-  **Client Interface**: Provides an interactive way for users to activate or deactivate the buzzer remotely.
-  **GPIO Management**: Handles hardware control with safe cleanup procedures for continuous operation.
-  **IoT Integration**: Supports scalable remote hardware automation within larger systems.
